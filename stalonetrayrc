# We are using stalonetray to create a small icon tray at the
# top right of the screen. You are likely to want to tweak the
# size of the icons and the width of the tray based upon the
# size of your screen and your xmobar configuration. The goal is
# to make stalonetray look like it is part of xmobar.

# Align icons with the "East" or right side of the tray.
icon_gravity E

# The width of the tray should be 5 icons wide by one icon tall, and it 
# should be located 0 pixels from the right of the screen (-0) and 0 pixels
# from the top of the screen (+0).
geometry 5x1-0+0

# By setting our maximum geometry to the same thing, the tray will not grow.
max_geometry 5x1-0+0

# The background color of the tray should be black.
background "#000000"

# This program should not show up in any taskbar.
skip_taskbar true

# Icons should be set to size "24". 
icon_size 24

# The "slot" that icons are shown in is "29" (adds padding around icons)
slot_size 29

# This kludge states: we really, truly want the icon_size we set. No really.

# window-strut "none" means windows are allowed to cover the tray. In
# other words, trust xmonad to handle this part.
